Distillation API
================

Teacher scoring, offline dataset labeling, and the offline distillation
strategy and loss terms for knowledge-distillation workflows.

Scoring
-------

A scorer turns a :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` into named teacher signals —
``energy``, ``forces``, ``stress``, ``node_energies``, and ``embeddings`` — each
mapped to a batch field, a level, and a canonical shape.
:class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.InProcessTeacherScorer` evaluates a
teacher loaded in the current process and leaves the scored batch exactly as it
found it, including neighbor tensors.

Scorers speak two public type aliases: ``SignalLevel``, the ``"node"`` or
``"system"`` level a signal is attached at, and ``TeacherLabels``, the
``{batch field: (detached tensor, level)}`` mapping
:meth:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.TeacherScorer.label` returns.


Labeling
--------

Offline labeling walks a dataset once, scores it, and writes the source fields
plus the teacher fields to a Zarr store that the ordinary reader and dataset
path consume. Runs are resumable, and the dense neighbor tensors are dropped
because they are rebuilt per chunk.

Strategy
--------

:class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.DistillationStrategy` is a
:class:`~nvalchemi.training.TrainingStrategy` over the named models
``"student"`` and ``"teacher"``. The teacher is frozen by omission from
``optimizer_configs``, the teacher signals are derived from the ``teacher_*``
targets the loss reads, and batches that arrive unlabeled are labeled on the fly
unless ``label_missing=False`` skips the teacher and lets the missing target
surface from the loss. ``training_fn`` stays a plain student forward, defaulting
to :func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.default_distillation_fn`, whose
``predicted_*`` keys are checked against the student's declared outputs at
construction.

Training and validation batches go through one labeling seam: an internal hook
on ``BEFORE_FORWARD``, a stage both loops dispatch on the device-placed batch.
Pointing ``validation_config`` at a store written by
:func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.label_dataset` still avoids the teacher
pass entirely.

Checkpoints serialize every entry of ``models``, so each write duplicates the
frozen teacher's weights; size the checkpoint interval accordingly with a large
teacher.

Losses
------

Every teacher signal shaped like a total energy, a force, or a stress is
consumed by a built-in loss term with its ``target_key`` pointed at the teacher
field — ``EnergyMSELoss(target_key="teacher_energy")``, and so on. Signals with
no supervised counterpart get their own term.

:class:`~nvalchemi.training.ComposedLossFunction` renormalizes its weights by
default, so composed weights are relative ratios: ``a + b + 0.2 * c`` runs at
``1/2.2``, ``1/2.2``, and ``0.2/2.2``. Build the composition with
``normalize_weights=False`` for literal coefficients, which also keeps a weight
schedule on one term from rescaling the others as it ramps.
