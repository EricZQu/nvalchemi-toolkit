Scoring
-------

A scorer turns a :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` into named teacher signals —
``energy``, ``forces``, ``stress``, ``node_energies``, and ``embeddings`` — each
mapped to a batch field, a level, and a canonical shape.
:class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.InProcessTeacherScorer` evaluates a
teacher loaded in the current process and leaves the scored batch exactly as it
found it, including neighbor tensors.

   SUPPORTED_SIGNALS

Scorers speak two public type aliases: ``SignalLevel``, the ``"node"`` or
``"system"`` level a signal is attached at, and ``TeacherLabels``, the
``{batch field: (detached tensor, level)}`` mapping
:meth:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.TeacherScorer.label` returns; the
signal names themselves are published as
:data:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.SUPPORTED_SIGNALS`. A custom scorer may
publish ``label_fields``, the batch fields its ``label()`` populates, which
consumers resolve through
:func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.scorer_fields` rather than reading the
attribute.

The in-process scorer reuses a batch's neighbor list only when it is a known
full list at the teacher's own cutoff and format. The core records the cutoff a
list was built at but not whether it holds each pair once, so a half-list
teacher, and any batch whose list the scorer did not build, gets a list that is
rebuilt for the forward pass and rolled back afterwards; a caller holding a full
list can opt into reuse by setting ``batch._neighbor_list_half = False``. A
composed pipeline keeps its default source's list as an instance attribute and
captures its whole per-source table alongside it; both are hidden from the
teacher for the duration of scoring, so a teacher scoring a live student batch
never reads the student's neighborhoods. A teacher composition that plans more
than one neighbor-list source is refused at construction, because the scorer
builds exactly one list per batch; compose it with
``neighbor_adaptation="always"`` or a ``max_cutoff_ratio`` of at least its
largest-to-smallest cutoff ratio so it adapts that one list per step.


Labeling
--------

Offline labeling walks a dataset once, scores it, and writes the source fields
plus the teacher fields to a Zarr store that the ordinary reader and dataset
path consume. Runs are resumable: the first ``len(store)`` samples are skipped,
a store that already covers the dataset is a no-op, and a store holding more
samples than the dataset — one written from a different dataset — is refused.
Every chunk must write the fields, levels, dtypes, and row shapes the store
holds, since the writer would otherwise misalign, cast, or truncate labels
without an error, and a store whose arrays disagree about how many samples it
contains — what an interrupted run leaves behind — is reported rather than
resumed from a misaligned offset.

The neighbor tensors are dropped by default. The dense ones cannot append into
a fixed-width store array, and a sparse list is dropped because the cutoff it
was built at is a batch attribute the store does not hold, so a reloaded list
is one nothing downstream can check; ``keep_neighbors=True`` stores the sparse
list anyway. Build the student's list from the stored positions with a
:class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.NeighborListHook` at ``BEFORE_FORWARD``. Labels may
be stored in any dtype an ALCHEMI store holds (``cast_to`` on the scorer picks
it), but they read back at the reading dataset's ``positions`` dtype, because a
dataset coerces every floating-point field it loads; the stored dtype governs
the store's size, not what training sees.

Labels are written with ``overwrite=True``, so a scorer that reached outside the
``teacher_*`` namespace would replace the reference field of that name and
persist the replacement. A scorer's declared ``label_fields`` is refused before
the first chunk is written, and the fields each chunk actually returns are
refused again per chunk, which is what polices a scorer that declares nothing.
