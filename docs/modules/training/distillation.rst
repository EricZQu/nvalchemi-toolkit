Scoring
-------

A scorer turns a :class:`~nvalchemi.data.Batch` into named teacher signals —
``energy``, ``forces``, ``stress``, ``atomic_energies``, and ``embeddings`` —
each mapped to a batch field, a level, and a canonical shape.
:class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.InProcessTeacherScorer` evaluates a
teacher loaded in the current process and leaves the scored batch exactly as it
found it, including neighbor tensors.

   signal_for_field
   SignalLevel
   TeacherLabels
   SUPPORTED_SIGNALS

Scorers speak two public type aliases: ``SignalLevel``, the ``"node"`` or
``"system"`` level a signal is attached at, and ``TeacherLabels``, the
``{batch field: (detached tensor, level)}`` mapping
:meth:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.TeacherScorer.label` returns; the
signal names themselves are published as
:data:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.SUPPORTED_SIGNALS`. A custom scorer may
publish ``label_fields``, the batch fields its ``label()`` populates, which
consumers resolve through
:func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.scorer_fields` rather than reading the
attribute.

The in-process scorer reuses a batch's neighbor list only when it is a known
full list at the teacher's own cutoff and format. The core records the cutoff a
list was built at but not whether it holds each pair once, so a half-list
teacher, and any batch whose list the scorer did not build, gets a list that is
rebuilt for the forward pass and rolled back afterwards; a caller holding a full
list can opt into reuse by setting ``batch._neighbor_list_half = False``. A
composed pipeline keeps its default source's list as an instance attribute and
captures its whole per-source table alongside it; both are hidden from the
teacher for the duration of scoring, so a teacher scoring a live student batch
never reads the student's neighborhoods. A teacher composition that plans more
than one neighbor-list source is refused at construction, because the scorer
builds exactly one list per batch; compose it with
``neighbor_adaptation="always"`` or a ``max_cutoff_ratio`` of at least its
largest-to-smallest cutoff ratio so it adapts that one list per step.


Labeling
--------

Offline labeling walks a dataset once, scores it, and writes the source fields
plus the teacher fields to a Zarr store that the ordinary reader and dataset
path consume. Runs are resumable: the first ``len(store)`` samples are skipped,
a store that already covers the dataset is a no-op, and a store holding more
samples than the dataset — one written from a different dataset — is refused.
Every chunk must write the fields, levels, dtypes, and row shapes the store
holds, since the writer would otherwise misalign, cast, or truncate labels
without an error, and a store whose arrays disagree about how many samples it
contains — what an interrupted run leaves behind — is reported rather than
resumed from a misaligned offset.

The neighbor tensors are dropped by default. The dense ones cannot append into
a fixed-width store array, and a sparse list is dropped because the cutoff it
was built at is a batch attribute the store does not hold, so a reloaded list
is one nothing downstream can check; ``keep_neighbors=True`` stores the sparse
list anyway. Build the student's list from the stored positions with a
:class:`~nvalchemi.hooks.NeighborListHook` at ``BEFORE_FORWARD``. Labels may
be stored in any dtype an ALCHEMI store holds (``dtype`` on the scorer picks
it), but they read back at the reading dataset's ``positions`` dtype, because a
dataset coerces every floating-point field it loads; the stored dtype governs
the store's size, not what training sees.

Labels are written with ``overwrite=True``, so a scorer that reached outside the
``teacher_*`` namespace would replace the reference field of that name and
persist the replacement. A scorer's declared ``label_fields`` is refused before
the first chunk is written, and the fields each chunk actually returns are
refused again per chunk, which is what polices a scorer that declares nothing.

Strategy
--------

:class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.DistillationStrategy` is a
:class:`~nvalchemi.training.TrainingStrategy` over the named models
``"student"`` and ``"teacher"``. The teacher is frozen by omission from
``optimizer_configs``, the teacher signals are derived from the ``teacher_*``
targets the loss reads, and batches that arrive unlabeled are labeled on the fly
unless ``label_missing=False`` skips the teacher and lets the missing target
surface from the loss. ``training_fn`` stays a plain student forward, defaulting
to :func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.default_distillation_fn`, whose
``predicted_*`` keys are checked at construction against the outputs the student
actually computes — its ``active_outputs`` intersected with its declared
``outputs`` — so a student whose active set is narrowed is caught before the run
rather than on its first batch. A ``teacher_*`` target that no built-in signal
populates — a field a custom scorer wrote through ``label_dataset`` — is read
from the batch as it arrives: it is neither derived into a signal nor attached
on the fly, so a batch lacking it surfaces as a missing loss target.

A ``validation_config`` carrying its own ``loss_fn`` takes part in both checks:
its ``teacher_*`` targets widen the derived signal set, and its prediction keys
are checked the same way whenever the effective validation function
(``validation_fn`` falling back to ``training_fn``) is the stock one. Neither
re-runs on assignment, so pass ``validation_config`` to the constructor or name
the wider set in ``teacher_signals``. Every resolved signal — derived or
explicit — is a request for its fields on every batch: a batch counts as
labeled only when it carries every resolved field, so adding a validation loss
with a new ``teacher_*`` target puts a training store written before it back on
the teacher, batch after batch, at identical values.

Training and validation batches go through one labeling seam: an internal hook
on ``BEFORE_FORWARD``, a stage both loops dispatch on the device-placed batch.
The teacher runs there with autocast disabled, so mixed-precision training does
not change the targets, and an on-the-fly label matches the offline one exactly
wherever the store returns the label dtype (see Labeling above): over the usual
float32 dataset every student but a float64 one agrees on both paths, while a
float64 student reads float32 back and needs a ``dtype_policy``. Labels are
never cast below single precision, so a ``bfloat16`` or ``float16`` student gets
float32 labels and needs ``dtype_policy="prediction_to_target"`` on its loss
terms. Pointing
``validation_config`` at a store written by
:func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.label_dataset` still avoids the teacher
pass entirely, and validating an EMA-averaged student against the live teacher
is ``ValidationConfig(use_ema="auto")``, reported as ``model_source="mixed"``;
``use_ema="always"`` currently also demands an inference-slot entry for the
frozen teacher and fails at the first validation pass without one.

The seam's work is callable directly:
:meth:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.DistillationStrategy.attach_teacher_labels`
attaches the ``teacher_*`` fields a device-placed batch is missing and reports
whether the teacher ran. It is idempotent, so pre-labeling a batch that later
reaches ``run()`` costs one teacher pass rather than two; a batch carrying only
some of the required fields is re-scored in full, since a partial set was
written for a different signal set than the objective reads.

Checkpoints serialize every entry of ``models``, so each write duplicates the
frozen teacher's weights; size the checkpoint interval accordingly with a large
teacher.

Losses
------

Every teacher signal shaped like a total energy, a force, or a stress is
consumed by a built-in loss term with its ``target_key`` pointed at the teacher
field — ``EnergyMSELoss(target_key="teacher_energy")``, and so on. Signals with
no supervised counterpart get their own term.

:class:`~nvalchemi.training.ComposedLossFunction` renormalizes its weights by
default, so composed weights are relative ratios: ``a + b + 0.2 * c`` runs at
``1/2.2``, ``1/2.2``, and ``0.2/2.2``. Build the composition with
``normalize_weights=False`` for literal coefficients, which also keeps a weight
schedule on one term from rescaling the others as it ramps.
