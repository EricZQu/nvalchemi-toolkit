class DistillationStrategy(TrainingStrategy):
    """Train a student against a frozen teacher's signals.

    ``DistillationStrategy`` is a :class:`~nvalchemi.training.TrainingStrategy`
    whose named models are ``"student"`` and ``"teacher"``. The teacher is
    frozen by omission — it must not appear in ``optimizer_configs``, which is
    what puts it in eval mode with gradients disabled for the duration of
    :meth:`run` — while the student, and any auxiliary model such as a
    projection head, must be configured with an optimizer.

    Teacher knowledge reaches the loss as ordinary batch fields. Every signal
    an :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.InProcessTeacherScorer`
    produces populates one ``teacher_*`` field, and a loss term consumes it by
    pointing its ``target_key`` there: ``EnergyMSELoss(target_key="teacher_energy")``,
    ``ForceMSELoss(target_key="teacher_forces")``,
    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.PerAtomEnergyMatchingLoss` for
    ``teacher_node_energies``. Mixing teacher targets with reference targets in
    one objective is therefore ordinary loss composition, and so is annealing
    between them with a
    :class:`~nvalchemi.training.losses.base.LossWeightSchedule`.

    Those targets also decide what the teacher is asked for.
    ``teacher_signals=None`` (the default) derives the signal set from the
    ``teacher_*`` targets the loss reads, so the two cannot drift apart; an
    explicit set must cover the derived one and may add more. The resolved set
    is checked against the teacher's declared outputs at construction, as is
    the model/optimizer contract above, so a misconfigured run fails before it
    starts rather than on its first batch.

    In offline distillation the labels travel with the sample. The intended
    path is :func:`~nvalchemi.training.distillation.label_dataset`: score the
    dataset once, persist the teacher fields into a Zarr store, and train from
    that store with no teacher forward pass at all. A batch that arrives
    without the required fields is labeled on the fly instead, unless
    ``label_missing=False`` rejects it, which keeps short runs and interactive
    sessions working without a labeling pass. Either way ``training_fn`` stays
    a plain student forward — :func:`default_distillation_fn` unless the caller
    supplies one — so the recipe survives :meth:`to_spec_dict` and the teacher
    never enters the student's autograd graph.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``models`` is not a named mapping containing ``"student"`` and
        ``"teacher"``, if the teacher is given an optimizer config, if the
        student or an auxiliary model is not, if the loss reads a ``teacher_*``
        target that maps to no known signal, if an explicit ``teacher_signals``
        omits a signal the loss needs, if no teacher signal is requested at
        all, or if the teacher cannot produce a requested signal.

    Examples
    --------
    Distill energies, forces, and the teacher's per-atom energy decomposition
    from a store written by :func:`label_dataset`:

    >>> import torch
    >>> from nvalchemi.training import EnergyMSELoss, ForceMSELoss, OptimizerConfig
    >>> from nvalchemi.training.distillation import (
    ...     DistillationStrategy,
    ...     PerAtomEnergyMatchingLoss,
    ... )
    >>> loss_fn = (
    ...     EnergyMSELoss(target_key="teacher_energy")
    ...     + ForceMSELoss(target_key="teacher_forces", normalize_by_atom_count=True)
    ...     + 0.1 * PerAtomEnergyMatchingLoss()
    ... )
    >>> strategy = DistillationStrategy(  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     models={"student": student, "teacher": teacher},
    ...     optimizer_configs={
    ...         "student": [OptimizerConfig(optimizer_cls=torch.optim.Adam)]
    ...     },
    ...     loss_fn=loss_fn,
    ...     num_steps=1_000,
    ... )
    >>> strategy.run(labeled_loader)  # doctest: +SKIP

    Notes
    -----
    Teacher conservativeness is deliberately not validated. A teacher that
    predicts forces with its own head rather than as the negative gradient of
    its energy is a first-class teacher here: the scorer detaches every signal
    it returns, so how the teacher produced a force never reaches the student.

    Validation batches are not labeled by the strategy: only the training path
    labels, and ``ValidationConfig.batch_callback`` fires after the validation
    loss has already assembled its targets, so a batch missing a ``teacher_*``
    target raises there. Three routes label validation data — point
    ``validation_config`` at a store written by :func:`label_dataset`, call
    :meth:`attach_teacher_labels` on each validation batch once before the run,
    or register a hook on ``BEFORE_FORWARD`` that calls
    ``attach_teacher_labels(ctx.batch)``, a stage the validation loop dispatches
    on the device-placed batch before its forward pass.

    On-the-fly labels are attached to the device-placed batch the strategy
    trains on, which is a copy of the one the caller handed over, so they do not
    persist on the caller's object. A loader that replays the same systems every
    epoch therefore costs one teacher pass per epoch, which is the other reason
    a long run should label its dataset offline first.
